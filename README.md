# CSC 375: Parallel Computing

## Course Overview
This repository contains projects and assignments related to CSC 375, a course on the design, implementation, and analysis of concurrent algorithms and systems. The course covers various topics, including atomicity, asynchrony, coordination, data structures, and algorithmic strategies for parallel computing.

### Course Details
- **Instructor**: Doug Lea

## Assignments
Each assignment focuses on different aspects of parallel computing and will be stored in separate folders within this repository. Each folder will contain its own `README.md` file with detailed information about the specific assignment, implementation details, and results.

### Assignments
- **[Assignment 1: Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Facilities Layout Problem](./FacilitiesLayoutProblem)**: 
  - Develop a parallel genetic algorithm to optimize the placement of stations in a two-dimensional factory layout.
  - Goals include maximizing affinity between stations based on their functions and distances.
- TBA


## Getting Started
- To use the project, direct to the related folder
**Solution Folder**  - represents java only code
**Frontend Folder**  - represents the frontend logic
**Backend Folder** - represents the integration of the solution with the backend server
